clone COPSolver from github.com/tbfraga/COPSolver to file /home/<youracc>/Documents/GitHub/ - if this folder do not exist create it
ps: <youracc> is your login (user)

create the folder /home/<youracc>/Documents/COPSolver/ if it do not exist

$ mkdir /home/work/Documents/COPSolver/

go to /home/<youracc>/Documents/GitHub/COPSolver/install/

$ cd /home/youracc/Documents/GitHub/COPSolver/install/

LINGOSolver folder to /home/work/Documents/COPSolver/LINGOSolver

copy opt/COPSolver/ folder to /opt/COPSolver/

$ sudo cp opt/COPSolver/ /opt/COPSolver/

create a link from COPSolver/COPSolver to /usr/bin/

$ sudo ln -s /opt/COPSolver/COPSolver /usr/bin/COPSolver

copy COPSolver.descktop file to /usr/share/applications/COPSolver.descktop

$ sudo cp usr/share/applications/COPSolver.desktop /usr/share/applications/COPSolver.desktop

Now you can run COPSolver from Applications menu.

PS: if you are using other ubuntu operational system you need to modify COPSolver.descktop file
you need to choose a installed terminal and change the following line
Exec=io.elementary.terminal -e COPSolver%F
usually it will solve any incompatibility problem
