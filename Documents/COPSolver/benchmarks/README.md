For using a benchmark, just copy the file, change the name for data.txt and then replace data.txt file on ../ (preciding folder).

You can also create a new benchmark. 

After running COPSolver you can also copy the files data.txt, output.txt and problem.txt into this folder, changing files names as you want.
